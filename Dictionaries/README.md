## ðŸ“– What Are Python Dictionaries?

Dictionaries are a built-in Python data structure that store data in key-value pairs. They are unordered, mutable, and indexed. Think of them as a way to organize data where each piece of information (the value) is associated with a unique identifier (the key).

```python
# Example
my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "is_student": True
}
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: Alice
